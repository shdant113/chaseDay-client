Storm chasing is a wild and unpredictable adventure that many people often pay thousands of dollars to have a slim chance of experiencing over a week-long period. Some people, on the other hand, become storm chasers. We forgo the paid tours, skip the fancy treatment, and learn how to make our time, money, and sacrifice pay off. We studied modeling, forecasting, navigating, and the process of converting what is often days of work, travel, and planning into a few successful minutes. Yet through all of our celebratory and not-so-celebratory dinners, long, tedious drives down the same highways, hours spent editing video after video, and total insanity as winter creeps in, lingers, and drives us all mad, there has never been one place where chasers of all the country and all the world can share with other chasers what we have accomplished.

ChaseDay provides a platform where users can post logs of the good days, total busts, and everything in between in a social media format. Users can also read other logs on their dashboard, easily passing those up that they do not find interesting or opening the log in order to read it in its entirety. Users can also message one another easily about their experiences and customize their profile with a cover photo and a highlight video of their favorite experiences.
